## <span style="color: darkblue;">1. Module learning objectives</span>

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

::: incremental
- Identify the  <span style="color: purple;">different types of data analysis questions</span> and categorize a question into the correct type.
- Identify a  <span style="color: purple;">suitable analysis type</span> to answer an  <span style="color: purple;">inferential question</span>, given the data set at hand.
- Use the `R` programming language to carry out analysis to answer inferential questions.
- <span style="color: purple;">Interpret and communicate the results</span> of the analysis from an inferential question.
:::

## <span style="color: darkblue;">2. What is the question?</span>

![The data analysis question type flow chart ([Leek and Peng, 2020](https://jtleek.com/ads2020/week-1.html#types-of-data-analytic-questions)). ](https://jtleek.com/ads2020/images/week1/questions.png){height="450"}

### <span style="color: darkblue;">2.1. Descriptive</span>

- One that seeks to <span style="color: purple;">summarize</span> a characteristic of a set of data. 
- <span style="color: purple;">No interpretation</span> of any summarized result is needed.

. . .

- For instance, we can compute <span style="color: purple;">the average of any given variable in our dataset</span>. 
- If we <span style="color: purple;">do not interpret</span> this average with respect to other data attributes, then our inquiry is merely descriptive.

![](img/data.png){fig-align="center" height=150}

#### <span style="color: darkblue;">Further descriptive examples</span>

- What is the frequency of viral illnesses <span style="color: purple;">in a set of data</span> collected from a group of individuals?
- <span style="color: purple;">How many people</span> live in each US state?

![](img/people.png){fig-align="center" height=350}

### <span style="color: darkblue;">2.2. Exploratory</span>

- One in which you analyze the data to see <span style="color: purple;">if there are patterns, trends, or relationships</span> between variables.
- This inquiry looks for patterns that would support proposing <span style="color: purple;">a hypothesis to test in a future study</span>.
- Nevertheless, any exploratory insights <span style="color: purple;">would be limited</span> to the data at hand.

![](img/exploratory.png){fig-align="center" height=200}

#### <span style="color: darkblue;">Exploratory examples</span>

- Do diets rich in certain foods have differing frequencies of viral illnesses <span style="color: purple;">in a set of data</span> collected from a group of individuals?
- Does air pollution correlate with life expectancy <span style="color: purple;">in a set of data</span> collected from groups of individuals from several regions in the United States?

![](img/pollution.png){fig-align="center" height=250}

### <span style="color: darkblue;">2.3. Inferential</span>

- One in which you analyze the data to see if there are patterns, trends, or relationships between variables in <span style="color: purple;">a representative sample of a population of interest</span>. 
- We want to quantify how much the patterns, trends, or relationships between variables apply <span style="color: purple;">to all individual units in the population</span>. 

. . .

- This class of inquiries would require formal statistical tools such as <span style="color: purple;">hypothesis testing or regression modelling</span>.

#### <span style="color: darkblue;">Inferential examples</span>

- Is eating at least 5 servings a day of fresh fruit and vegetables <span style="color: purple;">associated</span> with fewer viral illnesses per year?
- Is the gestational length of first born babies <span style="color: purple;">the same as</span> that of non-first borns?

![](img/control.png){fig-align="center" height=250}

### <span style="color: darkblue;">2.4. Causal</span>

- This inquiry asks about whether changing one factor will change another factor, on average, <span style="color: purple;">in a population</span>. 
- Sometimes, the underlying design of the data collection, by default, allows you to answer a causal question (e.g., <span style="color: purple;">randomized experiment or trial</span>).

![](img/population.png){fig-align="center" height=250}

#### <span style="color: darkblue;">However...</span>

- In other cases, the data collection <span style="color: purple;">does not allow</span> the analysis to establish any causality. 
- In particular, in observational studies, treatments <span style="color: purple;">are not controlled</span> by design! 
- <span style="color: purple;">Observed confounders</span> can be included in the analysis but <span style="color: purple;">unobserved ones</span> usually exist. Thus, causal effects cannot be naively established.

![](img/clinical-trial.png){fig-align="center" height=150}

#### <span style="color: darkblue;">Causal examples</span>

- Does eating at least 5 servings a day of fresh fruit and vegetables <span style="color: purple;">cause</span> fewer viral illnesses per year?
- Does smoking <span style="color: purple;">cause</span> cancer in BC elderly population?

. . .

> <span style="color: purple;">**Note:**</span> Designing an experiment where people are forced to smoke will be unethical! Observational data is often used in this case.

![](img/randomized-trial.png){fig-align="center" height=150}

### <span style="color: darkblue;">2.5. Mechanistic</span>

- One that tries to explain the <span style="color: purple;">underlying mechanism</span> of the observed patterns, trends, or relationship (<span style="color: purple;">i.e., how does it happen?</span>).

![](img/gears.png){fig-align="center" height=300}

#### <span style="color: darkblue;">Mechanistic examples</span>

- How do changes in diet <span style="color: purple;">help</span> to a reduction in the number of viral illnesses?
- How does airplane wing <span style="color: purple;">design</span> changes air flow over a wing, leading to decreased drag?

![](img/robot.png){fig-align="center" height=300}

### <span style="color: darkblue;">Challenge 1</span>

- What kind of statistical question is this?

> Is a yet undiagnosed patient's breast cancer tumor malignant or benign?

. . .

**Answer:**

> It is <span style="color: purple;">predictive</span>. Given some observed previous data, we would need <span style="color: purple;">to train a statistical or machine learning model</span> and use the modelling estimates to deliver a <span style="color: purple;">diagnosis prediction</span> conditioned on the patient characteristics.

### <span style="color: darkblue;">Challenge 2</span>

- What kind of statistical question is this?

> Is inhalation of marijuana associated with lung cancer?

. . .

**Answer:**

> It is <span style="color: purple;">inferential</span> since the question above aims to quantify an <span style="color: purple;">association</span> between two variables of interest: inhaling marijuana versus lung cancer (both are binary, i.e., **yes** or **no**).

### <span style="color: darkblue;">Challenge 3</span>

- What kind of statistical question is this?

> Does a truncation of the BRCA2 gene cause cancer?

. . .

**Answer:**

> It is <span style="color: purple;">causal</span>, not just because of the word "*cause*" but also for the <span style="color: purple;">context of the question</span>. A gene truncation involves <span style="color: purple;">a experimental study</span> to check whether there is an outcome from this study: <span style="color: purple;">cancer appearance</span>.

### <span style="color: darkblue;">Challenge 4</span>

- What kind of statistical question is this?

> Are there sub-types of ovarian tumors?

. . .

**Answer:**

> It is <span style="color: purple;">descriptive</span>. We merely seek to <span style="color: purple;">summarize</span> a given information in our dataset, which might be contained in a column called `Type of Ovarian Tumor`. That said, we are not seeking to make <span style="color: purple;">any further interpretations</span> on these summarized data in the context of this inquiry.

## <span style="color: darkblue;">3. So you know the type of question...</span>

<br>

![](img/panda.png){fig-align="center" height=400}

### <span style="color: darkblue;">3.1. What is next?</span>

- This helps <span style="color: purple;">narrowing down</span> the possibilities of the <span style="color: purple;">kind of analysis</span> you might want to do!

. . .

- For example, if you have the question: 

> How many viral illnesses will someone have next year? 

- And you identify that it is <span style="color: purple;">predictive</span>, you could narrow down that some kind of <span style="color: purple;">statistical or machine learning model</span> might help you answer that.

#### <span style="color: darkblue;">Then...</span>

- You would need to go a <span style="color: purple;">step deeper</span> and look at the data that you have, and see which kind of <span style="color: purple;">statistical or machine learning model</span> is most suitable for your data.

. . .

- We can use some hand <span style="color: purple;">modelling toolboxes</span>:
  + The [**scikit-learn algorithm**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/machine_learning_map.html) cheat sheet for predictive inquiries.
  + The [**regression mind map**](https://ubc-mds.github.io/DSCI_562_regr-2/notes/appendix-reg-mindmap.html) for inferential, causal, and predictive inquiries.

#### <span style="color: darkblue;">Another example</span>

- If you have the question: 

> Is the gestational length of first born babies the same as that of non-first borns in Vancouver Island?

. . .

- And you identify that it is <span style="color: purple;">inferential</span>. You could narrow down that some kind of statistical inference approach might help you answer that.

![](img/baby.png){fig-align="center" height=130}

### <span style="color: darkblue;">3.2. Then, again...</span>

- You need to go a step deeper and look at the data that you have, and see which kind of <span style="color: purple;">statistical inference approach</span> is the most suitable for your data.

## <span style="color: darkblue;">4. Practice</span>

<br>

![](img/notebook.png){fig-align="center" height=450}

### <span style="color: darkblue;">4.1. Case 1</span>

- **Question:** 

> Is a yet undiagnosed patient's breast cancer tumor malignant or benign?

. . .

- We can approach the above <span style="color: purple;">predictive</span> inquiry via the <span style="color: purple;">Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database</span> and a <span style="color: purple;">binary logistic regression model</span> which would allow to include additional features.

#### <span style="color: darkblue;">The Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database</span>

- The original dataset, from [Wolberg and Mangasarian (1990)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC55130/pdf/pnas01048-0130.pdf), can be found in the [**UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/15/breast+cancer+wisconsin+original).
- The `R` package [{mlbench}](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/mlbench/versions/2.1-5/topics/BreastCancer) contains a copy of this dataset.
- An illustration of this dataset (whose $n = 699$) can be seen below.

### <span style="color: darkblue;">4.2. Case 2</span>

- **Question:** 

> Is inhalation of marijuana associated with lung cancer?

. . .

- We can approach the above <span style="color: purple;">inferential</span> inquiry via a <span style="color: purple;">$\chi^2$ test</span>. Or a <span style="color: purple;">binary logistic regression model</span> which would allow to include additional features.

#### <span style="color: darkblue;">Some simulated data</span>

### <span style="color: darkblue;">4.3. Case 3</span>

. . .

- We can approach the above <span style="color: purple;">inferential</span> inquiry via a <span style="color: purple;">$\chi^2$ test</span>. Or a <span style="color: purple;">binary logistic regression model</span> which would allow to include additional features.

```

### <span style="color: darkblue;">4.4. Case 4</span>

- **Question:** 

> Are there sub-types of ovarian tumors?

. . .

- We can approach the above <span style="color: purple;">descriptive</span> inquiry via some <span style="color: purple;">data wrangling</span> and <span style="color: purple;">exploratory data analysis (EDA)</span>.

#### <span style="color: darkblue;">Some simulated data</span>

<br>

```{r}
#| echo: false

ovarian_dataset <- tribble(
  ~ID, ~Radius, ~Texture, ~Perimeter, ~Area, ~Smoothness,

### <span style="color: darkblue;">4.5. Some key notes</span>

- <span style="color: purple;">Identifying</span> whether there is a <span style="color: purple;">response variable</span> is important!
- The kind of response variable/target is critical <span style="color: purple;">for narrowing down the method</span>.
- The explanatory variables/predictors/features are also important, but we consider these after the response variable.

### <span style="color: darkblue;">4.6. A question for you!</span>

- Write down one statistical question you are trying to answer with your research.
- Identify the type of question it is.

![](img/crab.png){fig-align="center" width=70%}

## <span style="color: darkblue;">5. The statistical landscape in `R`</span>

- Let us check the [{tidyverse}](https://www.tidyverse.org/) collection of `R` packages designed for data science.

![](img/software.png){fig-align="center" height=350}

## <span style="color: darkblue;">6. Example of an inferential analysis in R</span>

> Is sexual activity associated with the longevity of male fruit flies?

<br>

**What kind of question is this?**

. . .

<span style="color: purple;">Inferential!</span>

## <span style="color: darkblue;">6.1. Data</span>

- Fruit flies were divided <span style="color: purple;">randomly</span> into groups of 13 each. 
- The <span style="color: purple;">response</span> was the longevity of the fruit fly in days. 
- One group was kept solitary (`isolated`), while another was given 8 virgin females per day (`high`).

. . .

- We will use two `R` libraries: <span style="color: purple;">{tidyverse}</span> and <span style="color: purple;">{faraway}</span> (where the data is available).

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(tidyverse)
library(faraway)
```


### <span style="color: darkblue;">Data wrangling</span>

```{r}
#| echo: true

fruitfly_data <- fruitfly |> 
  select(longevity, activity) |> 
  filter(activity == c("isolated", "high")) |> 
  mutate(activity = fct_drop(activity))

head(fruitfly_data)
tail(fruitfly_data)
```

## <span style="color: darkblue;">6.2. So how should we analyze this data?</span>

- What is our <span style="color: purple;">response variable</span>? What kind of data is it?

. . .

> The response is variable `longevity`, and it is <span style="color: purple;">numeric</span>.

. . .

- What is our <span style="color: purple;">explanatory variable</span>? What kind of data is it?

. . .

> The response is variable `activity`, and it is <span style="color: purple;">categorical</span>.

### <span style="color: darkblue;">What is a suitable statistical test?</span>

- A <span style="color: purple;">$t$-test</span> is suitable here (as would be a <span style="color: purple;">permutation test for difference of means OR medians</span>, or a <span style="color: purple;">Mann Whitney U Test</span>).

. . .

- To perform this, we need to parameterize our null ($H_0$) and alternative hypotheses ($H_A$):

. . .

\begin{gather*}
H_0: \text{There is no difference in mean longevity of sexually} \\
\text{active and non-sexually active male fruit flies.} \\
H_A: \text{There is difference in mean longevity of sexually} \\
\text{active and non-sexually active male fruit flies.}
\end{gather*}

### <span style="color: darkblue;">Always start with a visualization</span>

- The visualization should be related to your question!
- It should complement your statistical method(s).
- We are interested in <span style="color: purple;">means; population means</span>!

. . .

- So here, we should visualize our estimates of the population means, as well as our <span style="color: purple;">uncertainty</span> about them!

![](img/plots.png){fig-align="center" height=200}

### <span style="color: darkblue;">Visualizing estimates and their uncertainty</span>

1. <span style="color: purple;">Calculate</span> estimates and uncertainty.
2. <span style="color: purple;">Visualize</span> estimates and uncertainty, communicating as much about the underlying sample data as possible!

![](img/plots.png){fig-align="center" height=300}

### <span style="color: darkblue;">Calculate estimates and uncertainty</span>

- We calculate the <span style="color: purple;">sample means</span> and <span style="color: purple;">95% confidence interval (CI)</span> for a mean using the $t$-distribution, assuming independence and the <span style="color: purple;">Central Limit Theorem (CLT)</span>.

### <span style="color: darkblue;">Code</span>

```{r}
#| echo: true

fruitfly_2_estimates <- fruitfly_data |>
  group_by(activity) |>
  summarise(
    mean = mean(longevity),
    n = n(),
    se = sd(longevity) / sqrt(n()),
    df = n - 1,
    t_star = qt(0.975, df),
    lower = mean - t_star * se,
    upper = mean + t_star * se
  )
fruitfly_2_estimates
```

### <span style="color: darkblue;">Visualization</span>

```{r}
#| echo: true

fruitfly_2_estimates_viz <- ggplot(fruitfly_data, aes(x = activity, y = longevity)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, size = 2, alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_errorbar(
    data = fruitfly_2_estimates,
    mapping = aes(
      x = activity,
      y = mean,
      ymin = lower,
      ymax = upper
    ),
    width = 0.15, colour = "blue", linewidth = 1
  ) +
  stat_summary(
    fun = mean,
    geom = "point", shape = 18,
    size = 4, color = "orange"
  ) +
  ylim(c(0, 100)) +
  ylab("Longevity (days)") +
  xlab("Sexual Activity") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 22))
```

### <span style="color: darkblue;">The plot</span>

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 11.5
#| fig-height: 7

fruitfly_2_estimates_viz
```

### <span style="color: darkblue;">Running the test</span>

- We run a <span style="color: purple;">two sample $t$-test</span> assuming <span style="color: purple;">unequal population variances</span>.

```{r}
#| echo: true

fruitfly_2_ttest <- t.test(longevity ~ activity, alternative = "two.sided",
  data = fruitfly_data, var.equal = FALSE
)
fruitfly_2_ttest
```

### <span style="color: darkblue;">How do we parse this output?</span>

- Let us use library <span style="color: purple;">{broom}</span>.

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(broom)
fruitfly_2_ttest_tidy <- tidy(fruitfly_2_ttest)
fruitfly_2_ttest_tidy
```

### <span style="color: darkblue;">What are our conclusions?</span>

::: incremental
- The male fruit flies which were not sexually active were observed to have an increased lifespan (<span style="color: purple;">they lived `r round(fruitfly_2_ttest_tidy$estimate, 0)` days longer</span>).
- Specifically, the male fruit flies <span style="color: purple;">which were not sexually active</span> had a mean lifespan of `r round(fruitfly_2_ttest_tidy$estimate1, 0)` days with a 95% CI of <span style="color: purple;">[`r round(fruitfly_2_estimates$lower[1], 0)`, `r round(fruitfly_2_estimates$upper[1], 0)`]</span>.
- On the other hand, male fruit flies <span style="color: purple;">which were sexually active</span> had a mean lifespan of `r round(fruitfly_2_ttest_tidy$estimate2, 0)` days with a 95% CI of <span style="color: purple;">[`r round(fruitfly_2_estimates$lower[2], 0)`, `r round(fruitfly_2_estimates$upper[2], 0)`]</span>.

- Carrying out a <span style="color: purple;">$t$-test (assuming independence and the CLT)</span> with significance level $\alpha = 0.05$, indicated that we have enough statistical evidence to reject our null hypothesis $H_0$ (in favour of the alternative, $H_A$) as our $p$-value < 0.001 was much smaller than $\alpha$.
- Therefore, <span style="color: purple;">we can conclude there is a difference in the male fruit fly lifespan when males are sexually active compared to when they are not</span>.

### <span style="color: darkblue;">Finally...</span>

- Due to the <span style="color: purple;">randomized experimental design</span>, we might also suggest that this effect of sexual activity is causal on the change in lifespan! 
- **Specifically, sexual activity in male fruit flies decreases lifespan.**
